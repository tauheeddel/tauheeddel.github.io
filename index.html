Welcome to my personal research website! I proudly hold the position of Assistant Professor at Eastern Michigan University's School of Information Security & Applied Computing. Here's a snapshot of my journey:
I earned my B.Tech in Computer Engineering from Jamia Millia Islamia, New Delhi, India, in 2006, setting the foundation for my academic pursuits. Subsequently, I pursued an M.S. degree at The University of Toledo, Ohio, completing this milestone in 2015. The culmination of my academic journey came in the summer of 2019 when I obtained my Ph.D. in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) from The University of Toledo.
My career encompasses both academia and industry. I spent three years as a Software Engineer at HCL Technologies in India, followed by a four-year tenure at the renowned French multinational company SOPRA. My professional journey even led me to Toulouse, France, where I spent three months on-site at AIRBUS, overseeing their onboard application, Network Server System (NSS).
My research portfolio is diverse, covering a broad range of topics including Human-Computer Interaction, Cybersecurity, Autonomous Vehicles, and the exciting realm of Micro-controller devices such as Arduino and Raspberry Pi.
